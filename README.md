## DJIA Stock Predictor
This model was initially a  NLP problem looking at Reddit News Headlines and determining if there was any correlation between the headlines and the DJIA price movement. Then the analysis swithced over to a technical analysis to determine features that helped predict the daily closing prices. The regression model attempts to predict the future trend and closing prices of the DJIA in the future.
